\subsection{Extending the network}
The first round of experiments is dedicated to find out what conditions are required, such that the network seperates.
During a preliminary exploration phase, some scenarios where the network indeed seperates were found.
Yet, they were sparse and could not be easily interpreted.
Therefore, in this step the knowledge gained from the initial experiments is put to use.
A systematic evaluation on the relationship between network size and splitting behaviour was conducted.

To enable comparisson between networks of different sizes, the network extension technique described in REF was used.
First, an extensive experiment with a network architecture of 4-8-8-2 was conducted.
To expand the range of the results, two additional experiments were executed, which were slightly smaller to lower computational cost.
One experiment is done on a network with only one hidden layer, concretely with a shape 4-20-2, and the other experiment on a network with three hidden layers, a shape of 4-4-4-4-2.
All hyperparameters are shared amongst the three experiments.
The only difference is the pruning target, which is derived from the network architecture.

For all three experiments, the pruning rate was set to $0.32$.
The chosen value, while somewhat arbitrary, was selected by promising results on preliminary tests.
\textcite{DBLP:conf/iclr/FrankleC19} used a pruning rate of $0.2$ in the original experiments for the fully connected feed forward network trained on the MNIST dataset.
However with a larger pruning rate, a larger space of network sizes can be covered with the same number of iterations, which is why the larger pruning rate of $0.32$ was selected.

\subsubsection{Two hidden layers}
The first experiment was an extensive exploration of different model sizes by extending the network.
The base network, which is the network that is used as a base for extending, has the shape 4-8-8-2.
This architecture has 112 weights, which is also used as the pruning target.
The network architecture indicated by the number of neurons per hidden layer and the respective number of weights are displayed in \ref{tab:trajectory}.
The network is extended up to 25 times.
At the extension level 25, the network has a shape of 4-1310-1310-2, with 1.723.960 weights.
The number of extension levels corresponds to the number of pruning levels the network goes through.

Over all pruning levels, the network might seperate into two network or lose one of the inputs or outputs, which is called 'degrading'.
For the experiments described here, the run is stopped as soon as the network degrades to avoid unnecessary computational effort.
After each pruning level, the network is evaluated to check if it seperated or degraded.
When looking at this over the the course of all pruning levels, there are four different scenario for a network:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item seperated (and not degraded)\\
    The network seperates at some pruning level. 
    It does not degrade at any later level. 
    \item separated and later degraded \\
    The network splits at some point and has all input and output nodes.
    At a later level, the network degrades (it loses at least one input or output).
    \item degraded (and not seperate before) \\
    The network degrades before it can seperate.
    \item interconnected - not seperated and not degraged \\
    The network does neither seperate, nor degrade. 
    The result is a single network that contains all input and output nodes of all tasks.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{2-layer-histogram-split-behaviour.png}
    \caption{Proportional Stacked Area Chart}
    \label{fig:2laxer-histogram}
\end{figure}

At each extension level, the runs are repeated with four different seeds for the network initialization.
The results are displayed in figure \ref{fig:2laxer-histogram}.
The figure is a proportional stacked area chart.
Each scenario described above is encoded with a color.
On the x-axis, the extension levels are shown.
On the y-axis, the percentage of networks in each category can be view.
A clear pattern in the data is, that the network seperates for the first time with at least 7 pruning levels.
The shape and number of weights at that level is 4-38-38-2 and 1672 respectively, which is $~15$-times the amount of weights compared to the base model. 
Starting at shape 4-57-57-2 or extension level 9, which represents an increase of $~32$-times, the majority of the netowrks seperate.
Up until the 6-th extension level, no network seperates or degrades. 
However if the network would be pruned further, at some point every network would degrade.
Therefore it is also reasonable to assume that some of the networks that are still interconnected after all pruning iterations would seperate well, if they were pruned to less weights.

Another interesting observation is that only after extension level 10, the networks begin to degrade.
What follows from the data is, the more extension levels, the more likely it is that a network degrades, either before or after it seperated.

One possible explanation for this is that at each pruning level, a certain number of 'inactive weights' are produced.
As noted in \autocite{HanEtAl15, AllAlivePruning}, this is a known phenomenon.
However, since no regularisation is used in these experiments, the inactive weights do not decrease in magnitude.
Rather, they are frozen with they last value.
If more inactive parameters are created each pruning level than pruned, the percentage of inactive weights in the network grows over the iterations.
Therefore, the more pruning levels the network experienced, the less of its available, unpruned parameters are active.
This effectively makes the network smaller, which in turn makes it more likely to seperate or degrade.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{2-layer-compund-damage.png}
    \caption{
        The figure depicts the number of active weights after the last pruning iteration of extended networks.
        On the x-axis, the extension level is displayed.
        On the y-axis, the number of active weights at that level.
        A clear pattern emerges, showing a correlation between number of pruning iterations and the number of active weights in the final network.
    }
    \label{fig:collateral_damage}
\end{figure}

This effect is visible in \ref{fig:collateral_damage}.
The colors are encoded in the same way as in \ref{fig:2laxer-histogram}.
Each dot is a single run. 
The x axis represents the extension level.
On the y-axis the number of active weights after the last pruning level is display.
Important to note is that since when a network degrades (red), the run is immediately stopped.
Therefore in this graph, the degraded networks might have larger numbers of active weights, compared to other networks that were pruned for the total amount of levels.
However even with this caveat, a clear trend is visible.
The more pruning levels the network experiences, the smaller the percentage of the networks weights that is active.
For some networks that were extended 20 or more levels, the final percentage of active weights in the network is only around $20$ percent, which translates to only $~22$ active weights.

Techniques like L1-Regularisation used in \autocite{HanEtAl15} and ??\autocite{DBLP:conf/iclr/FrankleC19}?? or All-Alive-Pruning \autocite{AllAlivePruning} could counteract this effect of compounding inactive parameters.
However, this is a topic for future research and not addressed in this thesis. 

\subsubsection{When do networks seperate?}
One question regarding the seperation of a network is, at what level it seperates.
What is the number of available weights the network has at the level when it splits?
How does the number of extension levels / the networks size influence the iteration when it splits?

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{2-layer-active-available-at-split-log.png}
    \caption{
        The figure depicts the number of available weights / prunable weights (orange) and the number of active weights (blue) at the iteration when the networks first split.
        Each dot represents an average over four runs with different seeds.
        The error bars indicate the maximum and minimum value of the different runs.
        While the number of available weights at the split iteration increases, the number of active weights stays fairly constant.
        Logarithmic.
    }
    \label{fig:2l-active-split}
\end{figure}

Interestingly, when extending the network more, it tends to split in earlier pruning levels.
In figure \ref{fig:2l-active-split}, the number of available/unpruned weights (orange) weights at each pruning level is displayed.
Only the range of extension levels where the network seperated are displayed.
Each point on the line represents an average of three runs, repeated with different seeds for the network initialization.
The error bars depict the minimum and maximum value amonst those three repeated runs.
The graph is shown in a logarithmic scale, and the increase follows almonst an exponential curve.
The earlier the network seperates in terms of pruning levels, the more unpruned weights it has.
However, when looking at the the number of active weights the networks have at iteration they split, the curve does not have the same exponential growth trajectory.
It increases slightly but almost remains flat, covering a narrow range of around 80 to 120 weights.

TODO: revise. Does this make any sense?
This data indicate that the number of active weights is a central quantity to splitting.
Since the active subgraph is indeed the graph on which the splitting is checked, this seems plausible.
A certain 'barrier' might be inherent to each combination of network architecture, dataset and hyperparameters.
Given a dataset where there is exactly zero correlation between the two tasks might move the barrier towards higher number of edges where the network is likely to split.
A slight correltation, which is probably also the case in the Moons-Circles dataset and, might move the barrier lower.
Some hyperparameters or optimizers also might move the barrier, through being better suited to remove weights that connect the tasks.
For instance, techniques like L1 regularisation might move the barrier up, due to more efficient removal of weights that do not increase in magnitude, but also do not decrease on their own.
These are all questions for further research to tackle.
 
TODO: look at the iteration where it degrades.

\subsubsection{What makes the networks seperate?}
As seen in figure \ref{fig:2laxer-histogram}, the network starts to split at 7 extension levels and a network shape of 4-38-38-2, with 1672 weights.
However, it is not obvious what the main contributor for network splitting is.
To gain a better understanding of that phenomenon an experiment was conducted that compares different combinations of pruning levels, network size and pruning rate.
For this experiment, four architecture were selected.
One network with shape 4-31-31-2 (extension level 6), which did not seperate in any run.
A network with 38 and 48 hidden neurons (extension levels 7 and 8), where only one in four networks seperated.
And finally a network with 57 hidden neurons, where all four runs seperated.
This range of architectures is assumed to encompass a critical are, due to the change in splitting behaviour.
Further, each of the four architectures was trained with 0 to 10 pruning levels.
The pruning target is fixed at 112, such that all networks end up at the same number of prunable parameters after the last pruning level.
Therefore, the pruning rate is variable depending on network size and number of levels.
Each combination of network size and number of pruning levels was repeated four times, with different seeds for the network initialization.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{grid-2-layer-eval-abs.png}
    \caption{This Figure depicts the network size by the number of neurons per hidden layer (hidden dim) against the number of active weights after all pruning levels.
    The colors denote if the network seperated, degraded or stayed connected.}
    \label{fig:grid-1}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:grid-1} the impact of network size is demonstrated.
On the y-axis, the size of the network is encoded by its hidden dimension.
On the x-axis, the number of active weights after all pruning levels is depicted.
Each dot represents one run of the experiment.
Regarding the two smaller networks with hidden dimension 31 and 38, none of the networks seperated. 
Increasing the number of pruning levels and decreasing the pruning rate did not result in a seperated network.
On the other hand, the two larger networks indeed split.

These results indicates, that there is a phase change in the networks ability to seperate and that it has to have a certain minimum of overparameterization.
Clearly there is no hard boundary, but probably a significant increase in the likelihood of splitting when the network exceeds a certain size.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{grid-2-layer-pruning-rate-48-hd.png}
    \caption{This Figure depicts the network with shape 4-48-48-2.
    TODO:more }
    \label{fig:grid-2}
\end{figure}

To investigate the influence of pruning levels and pruning rate, the splitting behaviour of the network with hidden dimension 48 is depicted in fogure \ref{fig:grid-2}.
Since the pruning target and the network size is fixed, the pruning rate has to change when increasing the number of pruning levels.
On the bottom x-axis the number of pruning levels is depicted and on the top x-axis, the corresponding pruning rate.
On the y-axis, the number of active weights after all pruning levels is depicted.
With more pruning levels and a lower pruning rate, the network is more likely to seperate.
Also, a seemingly contradicting trend to figure \ref{fig:collateral_damage} is visible, namely that the number of active weights increases with more pruning levels.
The difference to the previous experiment is, that while the number of pruning levels increases in both cases, the pruning rate decreases in in this experiment, visible in figure \ref{fig:grid-2}. In the experiment depicted in figure \ref{fig:collateral_damage}, the pruning rate is constant, while the network size increases.

However, this data also indicates that there also is a certain phase change in the likelihood of splitting.
Since the pruning rate and the number of pruning levels are two tightly interlinked parameters, it is hard to examine them in isolation.
The largest pruning rate where a network seperated was $~0.65$. 
With pruning rates lower than $~0.41$, the networks consistently seperate.
The data indicates that more pruning levels with lower pruning rates are generally favorable to network splitting.
\textcite{DBLP:conf/iclr/FrankleC19} already note that iterative pruning leads to smaller lottery tickets than one shot pruning.
It is reasonable to assume, that the same phenomenon takes place with regards to network splitting.
Less pruning leves versus lower pruning rates represents a trade-off between favorable conditions and computational cost.

\subsubsection{One and Three hidden layers}
To gain a wider picture of the effects studied with regards to the network with two hidden layers, the same experiments were conducted on networks with one and three hidden layers.
As shown in \ref{tab:trajectory}, the networks were only extended for 15 and 17 levels instead of 25. 
This is due to computational constraints. As the networks get larger and the number of pruning levels is higher, the computational effort increases significantly.

For the network with one hidden layer a base with shape 4-20-2 was selected.
It has a similar number of weights compared to the base network with two layers.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{1-layer-active-available-at-split-log.png}
    \caption{This Figure depicts the network with shape 4-20-2.
    TODO:more }
    \label{fig:1layer-active}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{1-layer-histogram-split-behaviour.png}
    \caption{This Figure depicts the network with shape 4-20-2.
    TODO:more }
    \label{fig:1layer-histogram}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:1layer-histogram}, the same plot as for the two-layer experiment is presented.
A similar trend is visible.
After a certain number of pruning levels and network size, the networks begin to consistently split.
Given a few more pruning levels, the networks start to degrade more often, either before or after they seperate.
Interestingly, at iteration 12, the network starts degrade more often before it splits.
Begginging at 14 extension levels, where the networks are the largest, they never splits and only degrades.

Why? 

In figure \ref{fig:1layer-active}, the number of active weights (blue) in the network versus the number of available, unpruned weights (orange) is compared.
Only the range of extension levels where the network seperated are displayed.
The graph is displayed on a logarithmic scale.
Similarly to the experiment with two layers, the networks split in earlier iterations when they are larger and have more pruning levels.
This is indicated by the larger number of available weights, which directly correllates with the pruning level.
The number of active weights remains in a fairly tight range between 70 and 120 active weights.

Regarding the network with three hidden layers, the results are similar.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{3-layer-histogram-split-behaviour.png}
    \caption{This Figure depicts the network with shape 4-20-2.

    \label{fig:3layer-histogram}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{3-layer-active-available-at-split-log.png}
    \caption{The figure depicts the number of available weights / prunable weights (orange) and the number of active weights (blue) at the iteration when the networks first degrades.
    Each dot represents an average over five runs with different seeds.
    The error bars indicate the maximum and minimum value of the different runs.}
    \label{fig:3layer-active}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:3layer-histogram} the splitting behaviour is depicted.
A similar effect occurs but unlike the single layer network, the network does not stop to seperate in the range that was tested. 

In figure \ref{fig:3layer-active} the number of active weights and the number of available weights is displayed.
Only the range of extension levels where the network seperated are displayed.
The networks at extension level 7 until 11 all split at the last pruning level, which can be deducted by the number of available parameters which is equal to the pruning target of 108.
The number of active weights is slightly lower than in the other experiments.
Generally the same pattern can be seen, with a slightly more pronounced increase in active weights for larger networks.

\subsubsection{Performance of Lottery tickets}
are there differences in the performance of lottery tickets when they split?

compare 

\subsubsection{Conclusion: Network Extension}
They always split

multiple this have to be given

enough overparameterization
pruning rate low enough
enough pruning levels

Not clear how the splitting happens
Maybe unzipping?
What about the reguriating tickets interpretation?
What about regularization, weight decay and so on?
