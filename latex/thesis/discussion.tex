\chapter{Discussion}
Lottery Tickets are a young research only phenomenon.
Only small networks.
For practical purposes not so relevant

But they work really well.
Maybe they can help for Inerpretable Machine Learning

\section{Interpretable Machine Learning }
This could help finding the undderlying learned algorithm of neural nets given a problem.
Similar to what bimt tries to do.
Future work to test other data with Compositionality and weight sharing.
Or analyse data where there is no clear structure and see if the model develops independent modules

\section{Alternatives to Iterative Magnitude Pruning}
In this thesis I used IMP
But IMP is very inefficient and computationally expensive.
Maybe the other ways that are able to find lottery tickets can perform similar tasks and find structures.
With less omputational requirements.

\section{Beyond Toy Datasets}
The seperation of the function the network implements would be really nice for larger networks, not only for toy tasks.
